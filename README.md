# unopi
Emulating HID ( Human interface device such as keyboard and mouse ) using raspberry pi and Arduino Uno . 

### Features
* My setup have more control over sending keys to system like delay between each keystroke etc .
* It can be remotely controlled over wifi or bluetooth .
* It can be scripted with both python and ducky script , hence can be more dangerous because of more control .
* You can create a situation on your system and record those actions and use those actions as payload with my setup .
* With my setup you can generate live payload keystroke by keystroke and then those keystroke will be repeated on the victim's system . Very helpful in forensics when you are not present at the location of evidence .
* It is cheaper than ducky .
* It can used for multipurpose like password generator etc .

### Full and clear documentation is avialable in [Unopi](https://github.com/mohitrajain/unopi/blob/master/unopi.pdf)

### Todo List :
* Automatic Installation scripts
* Documentation
* Record and Replay
* Keyboard Copy Device
